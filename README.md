# clitime
A simple CLI timer/stopwatch for Unix-based systems. (Windows support in the future...)

## Installation instructions 
1. Clone repository 
2. Enter repo directory and `make` (for Unix-based systems). 

## Usage 
1. Run with either the `--stopwatch` or `--timer` options. 
2. For the `--timer` option, enter a time in the format `XhYmZs`. Any combination of (hour/minute/second) can be used, but **must be in that order**.  Eg. 10m20s == 10minutes 20seconds, 1h5m == 1hour5minutes, 30s == 30seconds, 2m == 2minutes, etc.
